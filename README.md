Python script that reads a web server log file and prints each line with IP addresses converted to hostnames.

Running:

- If python is not installed on your computer, first install. https://www.python.org/downloads/

- Then go project directory from terminal and run "python weblog.py"

- It will print hostnames of IP addresses which is in logs.txt.

Note: I couldn't find nice sample web server log file so I created one with some dns ip addresses based on given log sample. If you put a log file with same name and format it will work too.
